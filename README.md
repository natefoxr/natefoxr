# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @natefoxr

#### My name is Nate Moudakis; I recently graduated with a B.S. in Business Administration and am looking to further develop my skills in Computer Science.

I graduated from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo in June of 2021, with a dual concentration in accounting and computer information systems. My accounting coursework at Cal Poly enabled me to develop a deep understanding of the business environment and ability to read & understand the financial health of a company or industry based on financial information and forecast that data on both a micro and macro scale. Studying accounting at a Polytechnic STEM school gave me the tools to understand the complexities and metrics surrounding liquidity, collateralization and volatility. Through my studies of information systems I developed a highly sophisticated understanding of networks, centralization and decentralization as well as the history of the internet from ARPANET to Web 3.0. I also have skills in programming and love working to optimize and automate tasks. I work primarily in the Ruby and Python programming languages and Ruby on Rails Framework but also have knowledge of Solidity, JavaScript, C++, HTML, CSS, SQL, and OS command line languages (Powershell, Bash) with a passion to learn more!

Install my Ruby gem `gem install natemoudakis` then in the ruby console `require "natemoudakis"` and run `NateMoudakis.nate` for my contact information or visit my website [foxr.xyz](www.foxr.xyz).
